# Hello, I'm Bradford Bossen

I am a full-stack developer ready to solve any problems you have. I have the most experience with JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, HTML, and CSS; but I also can pick up any language. I enjoy working on challenging projects, and I love to solve interesting problems.

I have over 17 years of total work experience that has taught me the importance of communication and working with your team. I have spent time in many different industries, from audio engineering to restaurants. I also spent time refining my problem-solving and leadership skills as a foreman for a moving company. That experience as a foreman taught me how important teamwork is, and how to think outside the box when solving complex problems.

My interest in computers started at a very young age, building one for our family at the age of 12 so we could have a computer. From there I gained experience troubleshooting a variety of computer and networking problems. Now that I am entering into the tech industry, this experience will help keep my productivity high without any IT help.

### Technologies and Skills

JavaScript, React, Node.js, jQuery, HTML5, CSS, a11y, NPM, Express, Postgres, Github, Mocha, Chai, Jest, Cypress, Bash, and Agile.
